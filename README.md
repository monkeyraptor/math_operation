# Math Operations
*Some mathemathical functions in JavaScript*

This is not overriding built-in Math method, just a custom function.

Meanwhile, it consists of:

1. Combination: `math.combination(n, k)`

2. Permutation: `math.permutation(n, k)`

   >n is **total number**

   >k is the number of **combination** or **permutation**
   
   >As in `C(5, 2) = 10**` or `**P(5, 2) = 20**`
