# Math Operations
***Some mathematical functions in JavaScript***

This is not overriding built-in `Math()` method, just a custom *module* with different functions combined.

## DEMO

[`At CodePen`](http://codepen.io/monkeyraptor/full/YXzPvN/)

![UI snapshot](https://jpython27.appspot.com/custom_math_ui.png)

>The demo uses the [`custom_math_2.js`](https://github.com/monkeyraptor/math_operation/blob/master/demo/custom_math_2.js) (in `demo` folder).

The difference~~s are~~ is:
- ~~The demo's user interface handler: It won't work for input with `-` (dash)~~ Update: it's now available for negative number input. So this is not categorized as difference. Uh huh.
- The demo is using ~~all~~ `while` (the script on the HTML is using `do-while`) for the looping (testing purpose). The original one ([`custom_math.js`](https://github.com/monkeyraptor/math_operation/blob/master/custom_math.js)) is all using `for`.
 
> For transforming `do-while` (with `break`) to `forEach`, I typed a gist [`right there`](https://gist.github.com/monkeyraptor/6e5579920b6ccf8153ed). By default, there's no `break`-ing in `forEach`, thus we need to tinker the script flow so it fits the loop block.

I'll be adding more of them lator. Feel free to add more or fork or whatever.

Meanwhile, it consists of:

###1. **Factorial**

   Usage: `math.factorial(n)`

   >Example: `math.factorial(3)` will generate output `6` (number).

###2. **Combination**

   Usage: `math.combination(n, k)`

   >Example: `math.combination(5, 2)` will generate output `10` (number).

###3. **Permutation**

   Usage: `math.permutation(n, k)`
  
   >Example: `math.permutation(5, 2)` will generate output `20` (number).

   >n is **total number**

   >k is the number of **combination** or **permutation**
   
   >Also, browser only *accommodates* 21 digits without compacting it with the *exponent*. So, that.
   
###4. **Adding comma for large integer**
   
   Usage: `math.addcomma(your_number)`
 
   >`your_number` can be positive or negative. It has to be **number** (**integer**). If it has decimal point, it will be rounded down to nearest integer. Once again, browser only *accommodates* 21 digits before it is **compacted** using exponent.

   >Examples: 
   >- `math.addcomma(10000.8)` will generate output `10,000`. It is a `string` output.
   >- `math.addcomma(-28900251)` will generate output `-28,900,251` (`string`).

   >This *isn't* actually a math operation, more like *structuring-number-so-it-can-be-read*.

###5. **Generating Fibonacci sequence**
   
   Usage: `math.fibonacci(1st_number, 2nd_number, how_many)`

  >You have to provide all three arguments. ~~Each has to be **non-zero**~~ `1st_number` and `2nd_number` can be zero and `how_many` has to be **greater than 0**. It will also be rounded down to nearest integer if you put number with decimal point.
  
  >Example: `math.fibonacci(-1, 2, 5)` will generate output: `-1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11` (`string` output). It started from -1 and 2, then generated 5 additional numbers sequence.

###6. **Get the factors of positive integer**
   
   Usage: `math.factorof(the_number, flag)`
  
   >It has `flag`. `0` to return only the factors (string). `1` to return list of multiplications of the factors.
   
   >This is using iterations, so put considerably *small* input to avoid browser crash. It should work fine with max 5 digits length (99,999) input. *I didn't put actual limit in this*.
   
   >If the input is negative, it will be converted into positive.

   >Examples:
   >- `math.factorof(625, 0)` or just `math.factorof(625)` will generate output `1, 5, 25, 125, 625` (string).
   >- `math.factorof(625, 1)` will generate output `1 * 625, 5 * 125, 25 * 25` (string).

###7. **Check prime number**
   
   Usage: `math.prime_check(the_number)`
  
   >The `the_number` has to be greater than 1 and an integer.
   
   >Examples:
   >- `math.prime_check(210000000)` will generate output `Not a prime number` (string).
   >- `math.prime_check(31)` will generate output `PRIME number` (string).

   >Demo with user interface [on PortRaptor](http://portraptor.blogspot.com/2014/04/prime-number-checker.html)

###8. **Generate prime numbers**
   
   Usage: `math.generate_prime(start_from, how_many)`
  
   >The `start_from` has to be greater than 1 and an integer. `how_many` has to be larger than 0.
   
   >Examples:
   >- `math.generate_prime(2, 3)` will generate output `2, 3, 5` (string).
   >- `math.generate_prime(4, 1)` will generate output `5` (string).

   >Demo with user interface [on PortRaptor](http://portraptor.blogspot.com/2014/05/prime-number-generator-by-monkey-raptor.html)

###9. **Generate Pascal's triangle sequence**
   
   Usage: `math.pascal_triangle(which_line [or] how_many, flag)`
  
   >The `which_line [or] how_many` has to be natural number (N*). `flag` can be 0 or 1.
   
   > - `flag` 0 is for generating a particular line of Pascal's triangle sequence.
   > - `flag` 1 is for generating all lines of Pascal's triangle sequence until the given limit.
   
   **PLEASE NOTE that this is using iteration, so, limit the input. I recommend around 20-ish. It will still work smoothly with that input range. Above that, the it'll "break" the browser.**
   
   >Examples:
   >- `math.pascal_triangle(2, 0)` will generate output `1, 1` (string).
   >- `math.pascal_triangle(3, 1)` will generate output `1 | 1 1 | 1 2 1` (string).

###10. **Least Common Multiple (LCM)**
   
   Usage: `math.lcm(num_1, num_2[, num_3])`
  
   >`num_3` is optional. It can calculate 2 or 3 arguments.
  
   > Each input must be natural number (N*) (non-zero positive integer)
  
   >Examples:
   >- `math.lcm(12, 18)` will generate output `36` (number).
   >- `math.lcm(15, 8, 42)` will generate output `840` (number).

###11. **Greatest Common Factor (GCF)**
   
   Usage: `math.gcf(num_1, num_2[, num_3])`
  
   >`num_3` is also optional. It can calculate 2 or 3 arguments.
   
   > Each input must be natural number (N*) (non-zero positive integer)
   
   >Examples:
   >- `math.gcf(12, 15)` will generate output `3` (number).
   >- `math.lcm(51, 18, 42)` will generate output `3` (number).

## String to array
   If you need to get `array` from `string` output for your other additional functions, it can be done with:
   
   ```javascript
   the_array = the_string_output.split(", ");
   ```
   > This mostly uses `join(", ")` to convert the `array` into `string` output. Except the **pascal_triangle** and **factorof** with `flag` 1. You can customize the `join()` part in those.
   
##How to use it in HTML

Grab the [`custom_math.js`](https://github.com/monkeyraptor/math_operation/blob/master/custom_math.js), you can compress it yourself (recommended [`tool`](http://gpbmike.github.io/refresh-sf/)).

Then:
```html
<html>

    <head>
   
        <!--your head content-->
          
        <script>
            /* 
            \  *custom_math.js* goes here. It can be in HTML or external (synchronous with [script] tag).
            */
        </script>
      
    </head>
   
    <body>
   
        <!--your body content-->
     
        <p>
            So, blabla, something something, as such, we have the total ways of doing that, like:
            <!--For instance, this is the element to be injected with *combination* result-->
            <div id="something"></div>
        </p>
        
        <script>
            //this is the element with id *something*
            var your_element = document.getElementById("something");
         
            //invoking the *combination* function and injecting the result to that element:
            your_element.innerHTML = "Combination(5, 2) = " + math.combination(5, 2);
        </script>
      
    </body>
   
</html>
```

###Loading externally and asynchronously

For loading the script from *external* storage (not placed in the HTML) and *asynchronous*, read these gists:

1. ***Not recommended*** [`Gist one`](https://gist.github.com/monkeyraptor/532517be33ead64e57f5): using `script` tag with `async` attribute and using timer to detect the *readiness* of the external script.

2. [`Gist two`](https://gist.github.com/monkeyraptor/339905bc5edc703b9f92): inject the `script` element via JS.
