# Math Operations
*Some mathemathical functions in JavaScript*

This is not overriding built-in Math method, just a custom function.

Meanwhile, it consists of:
1. Combination
   Usage: `math.combination(n, k)`
2. Permutation
   Usage: `math.permutation(n, k)`
   >n is **total number**
   >k is the number of **combination** or **permutation**
   >As in `C(5, 2) = 10**` or `**P(5, 2) = 20**`
