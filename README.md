# Math Operations
*Some mathemathical functions in JavaScript*

This is not overriding built-in Math method, just a custom function.

Meanwhile, it consists of:

1. Factorial. Usage: `math.factorial(n)`

2. Combination. Usage: `math.combination(n, k)`

2. Permutation. Usage: `math.permutation(n, k)`

   >n is **total number**

   >k is the number of **combination** or **permutation**
   
   >As in `C(5, 2) = 10` or `P(5, 2) = 20`
   
   >Also, browser only *accomodates* 21 digits without compacting it with the *exponent*. So, that.
